# escape-room-projectESCAPE ROOM

You must create an escape room game using the Inquirer package to take values from the
user, only needs to run in the Command Line Interface (CLI) and must have the following.
â€¢ At least 4 uses of interaction with Inquirer (4 functions)
â€¢ At least 4 functions that help, change or decide users path
â€¢ Show an example of a class and subclass
How you organise your files is up to you, but would recommend you keep all functions separate,
Inquirer functions separate and any stored variables or object separate.
You must plan this in advance by creating a User Flow.
To submit:
â€¢ Github repository of escape room - use git collaboration
â€¢ User flow
â€¢ Any other tool used (Trello board)
Stretch Goals
Add ascii art, colour text or any other npm library to customise the terminal
â€¢ chalk - npm (npmjs.com)
â€¢ Import another library to use in your application
â€¢ superheroes - npm (npmjs.com)
â€¢ dinosaurs - npm (npmjs.com)
â€¢ random-words - npm (npmjs.com)


Plan:
Set up collaborative git repository
Add  branches to it 
Create a trello board and added the others to it 

Ideas:
Pokemon styled - take this option go one way or another 
riddles

Do the user flow diagram:
User = (name)
Class = Each pokemon > health 100 at start - if use their special power to complete riddle you lose points 
Subclass = pikachu / squirtle / bulbasaur / charmander ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©

1st interaction: username - input
2nd: Pick a pokemon - list > decides a path > 
3rd: encounters other pokemon to battle or run (riddles) - 1st has to battle 
4th: another path to decide
5th: another riddle - harder

Start > pick username (input) > choose a pokemon (list) - show strength/power > are you sure(confirm) - if yes continue if no choose again (loop) > each pokemon decides a different path > battle pokemon riddle (input) > if incorrect ask try again or reduce health using pokemon power > if correct carry along path > new riddle > continue â…” more riddles until reach pokemon gym
